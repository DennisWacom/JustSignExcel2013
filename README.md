# JustSignExcel2013

This is an Excel 2013 plugin (also support Excel 2015), to use Wacom Signature SDK to capture signatures in Excel.

## Usage

After installing, there should be a "Add-ins" tab in Excel, and a "Capture" button available to capture signatures.
First, select a cell, then click the Capture button. A signature pop up will appear to capture your signature from a Wacom device. After clicking the "OK" button, the signature will appear in the selected cell.

## Prerequisite
